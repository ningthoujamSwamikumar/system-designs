# Basic OOP Concepts
    Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
    are the four concepts that Object Oriented programming, and 
    Object Oriented Designs are based on. These concepts allow us
    to treat the states in a program like real world objects. 
### Abstraction 
    This concept has to do with handling complex programs by breaking
    down to simpler components. It creates different level of a system.
    At each level, we expose or show only the necessary methods hiding all
    other implementation details. Abstraction focuses on the functionality a
    component needs to have.
### Encapsulation
    This concept also hides the unnecessary details like the concept of Abstraction, however,
    this is implemented in class levels.
    Encapsulation bundles data and methods that work on them, control access to them, and
    ensures data integrity, and security.
### Inheritance
    It is the concept of a class (subclass/child) inherits all the properties and behaviour
    of another class(super/parent). This allows extension of classes, and enables reusability 
    of classes.
### Polymorphism
    Concept which allows an object to become different types which shared a common interface.
    This is achieved with method overriding, and interfaces.
